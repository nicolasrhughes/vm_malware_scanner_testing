# vm_malware_scanner_testing
A program designed to explore the concept of validation in the context of a malware scanner used for digital forensic purposes.

Basic use:
  1) Install VM host. Currently, this software has been designed and tested for Virtualbox, but with some modification, any VM host
  with either API or command-line access should function nicely.
  2) Prepare a test VM with a SSH login enabled. Make sure the VM's disk is converted to raw and is attached to the VM on shutdown.
  3) Download executable malware files, place in media_path
  4) Set up a project directory 
  5) Prepare a configuration file
  6) Configure test.py as needed

Preparing a configuration file: 

  Here are the contents of a sample configuration file. Most of this is self-explanatory, 
  but a few of the folders might need a bit of explanation. The image_path is where derivative
  evidence (working images) are stored. The output_path is where the validation tool output is stored,
  while the logging path is where verbose data is stored. Right now, the program uses a simplistic
  infection protocol (wait for computer to boot, wait to grap IP, wait for infection process, wait for the VM
  to shutdown.The offset portion is to avoid running into any drive information modified by the virtual disk
  as we are not particularly interested in what Virtualbox is doing.

Sample configuration file follows:

project_path: /PATH_TO_PROJECT_HOME
image_path: /PATH_TO_PROJECT_HOME/image
log_path: /PATH_TO_PROJECT_HOME/log
output_path: /PATH_TO_PROJECT_HOME/output
